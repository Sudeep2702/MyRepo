/fix , explain 

git : it is a software

version control system to track the changes in the code and collborate

github : it is a proper website software where we upload the project

repository - folder
we can create and also copy the repo
changes = commit 
every commit is tracked 
1 . confirm the change 
2 . commit the change

Installation

1. after the installation and set up we need to
2 . configure the git

operations /commands

features                   commands
1.clone -               git clone <some link>   (clone is better with https)
2.hidden folder access  ls -a
3.folder access         ls
4. status               git status  (if m then its modified so u have to commit the changes

After Modifying 
2 step process - add and then commit
 
5.add a file            git add <file name>
6.add all files         git add .
7.commit                git commit -m "some message"
8.pusing from local     git push origin main
  to git hub

when we create a project first on local and then we need to create
and push the project to new repo

  first go to new folder
  check git is there or 
  not using                 ls -a

1.create new localrepo       git init (now git is initialised and u can find .git in ls-a)
                             git add . add all files
			     git commit
2.push the same proj
 inside the git

 substeps

  1.create a new repo 
    inside the git
  2.now add the repolink using :   git remote add origin <link> 
  3.verify it                  :   git remote -v

Branches : when ever many are working on a same project each will be assigned a diff branch
  4.to check the branch        :   git branch
  5.to rename                  :   git branch -M <newname>
  6.push                       :   git push -u origin <newname> (-u means telling gitbash
                                      



untracked -- git wont track
modified -- its modified 
staged -- file is ready to commit (after add )

unmodified -- u



note : Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit. 
means : vs code commit is one step ahead and its still not visible inside the github

git push -u origin main : that  will be commiting to the same origin for long time
