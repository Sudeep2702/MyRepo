git : it is a software

version control system to track the changes in the code and collborate

github : it is a proper website software where we upload the project

repository - folder
we can create and also copy the repo
changes = commit 
every commit is tracked 
1 . confirm the change 
2 . commit the change

Installation

1. after the installation and set up we need to
2 . configure the git

operations /commands

features                   commands
1.clone -               git clone <some link>   (clone is better with https)
2.hidden folder access  ls -a
3.folder access         ls
4. status               git status  (if m then its modified so u have to commit the changes

After Modifying 
2 step process - add and then commit
 
5.add a file            git add <file name>
6.add all files         git add .
7.commit                git commit -m "some message"
8.pusing from local     git push origin main
  to git hub

when we create a project first on local and then we need to create
and push the project to new repo

  first go to new folder
  check git is there or 
  not using                 ls -a

1.create new localrepo       git init (now git is initialised and u can find .git in ls-a)
                             git add . add all files
			     git commit
2.push the same proj
 inside the git

 substeps

  1.create a new repo 
    inside the git
  2.now add the repolink using :   git remote add origin <link> 
  3.verify it                  :   git remote -v

Branches : when ever many are working on a same project each will be assigned a diff branch
  4.to check the branch        :   git branch
  5.to rename                  :   git branch -M <newname>
  6.push                       :   git push -u origin <newname> (-u means telling gitbash

  7.to switch between the      :   git checkout <branch name>
  8.TO CREATE NEW BRANCH       :   git checkout -b <new branch name>
  9.TO delete                  :   git branch -d <branch name>
    branches
                                      
  10.to check differences      :   git diff <branch name>

                 MERGING METHODS - 1) merge 2) create a pr or Pull request
  11.TO merge                  :   git merge <branch name>
  12> After merging            : git pull origin main

  undo
   
  13. for resetting it to 
        previous commits       :  git reset --hard <commit code>(code from git log) 

untracked -- git wont track
modified -- its modified 
staged -- file is ready to commit (after add )
fork   -- to copy the repo to our account from others repo

unmodified -- u



note : Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit. 
means : vs code commit is one step ahead and its still not visible inside the github
        that i will be commiting to the same origin for long time

Pull Request :

when there are many developers and all have their different branches and then
want to add it to main ..then they generate pull requests...Senior developer 
reviews and then confirm merges
   

git conflicts:
when git is unable to resolve code differences  between commits
